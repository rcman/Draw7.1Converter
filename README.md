# Draw7.1Converter
This is a converter which takes the raw file from my draw program and makes them in to BMP files

The saved filed from the draw program are saved with extension .std

The converter works by saving the STD file in the desination name or your choice. The desination name must also be the directory name. 

Example

stdconv sample1.std  myname

there must be a directory called myname
